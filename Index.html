                Rairangpur,
                Odisha.Her name given by her family was Puti Tudu. She was renamed by her school teacher to
                Droupadi. Her name was changed several times and she was also named Durpadi, Dorpdi in past.[6] Her
                father and grandfather were traditional heads of the village council. Murmu is an arts graduate of Rama
                Devi Women's College.

                She married a banker in 1980[8][9] with whom she had two sons and a daughter. Her husband, two sons,
                mother, and a brother all died in a span of 7 years, from 2009 to 2015.[10][11][12] She is a follower of
                the Brahma Kumaris spiritual movement.</p>
            <h2>Career :-</h2>
            <p class="paragrapgh">From 1979 to 1983, Murmu worked as a junior assistant at the irrigation department of
                the Government of Odisha.
                She then worked as a teacher at the school Sri Aurobindo Integral Education Centre, Rairangpur and
                taught Hindi, Odia, Maths and Geography.</p>
            <h2>Political career :-</h2>
            <p class="paragrapgh">Droupadi Murmu joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Rairangpur. In 1997 she was
                elected as the councilor of the Rairangpur Nagar Panchayat.

                She won the 2000 Odisha Legislative Assembly election from Rairangpur Assembly constituency and served
                two terms in the Odisha Legislative Assembly between 2000 and 2009.[2] During the BJP and BJD coalition
                government in Odisha, she was the Minister of State with Independent Charge for Commerce and
                Transportation from March 6, 2000, to August 6, 2002, and Fisheries and Animal Resources Development
                from August 6, 2002, to May 16, 2004.

            <h2>Governor of Jharkhand (2015â€“2021) :-</h2>
            <p class="paragrapgh">Murmu was sworn in as the Governor of Jharkhand on 18 May 2015, becoming the first
                woman to hold the position.[16] The BJP was in power in the Jharkhand Government for most of her
                six-year tenure as a governor and was also in power in the Union Government throughout her tenure.[17]

                Ratan Tirkey, a former BJP politician and activist, said that Murmu had not done enough to make sure
                that the self-governance rights granted to tribal communities were properly implemented. These rights
                were granted under the Fifth Schedule and the Panchayats (Extension to Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996 or
                PESA. Tirkey said, "Despite several requests, the then governor never exercised her powers to implement
                the Fifth Schedule provisions and Pesa in letter and spirit".[17]

                Her six-year tenure as Governor began in May 2015 and ended in July 2021.</p>
